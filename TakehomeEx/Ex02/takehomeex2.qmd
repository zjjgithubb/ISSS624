# Overview of the Exercise

::: panel-tabset
## Setting the Scene

What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.

To provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!

As city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.

Unfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner's ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data.

## Motivation and Objective

This take-home exercise is motivated by two main reasons. Firstly, despite increasing amounts of open data available for public consumption, there has not been significant practice research carried out to show how these disparate data sources can be integrated, analysed, and modelled to support policy making decisions.

Secondly, there is a general lack of practical research to show how geospatial data science and analysis (GDSA) can be used to support decision-making.

Hence, your task for this take-home exercise is to conduct a case study to demonstrate the potential value of GDSA to integrate publicly available data from multiple sources for building a spatial interaction models to determine factors affecting urban mobility patterns of public bus transit.

## The Data

### Open Gov Data

For the purpose of this assignment, data from several open government sources will be used:

-   *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops*, *Bus Stop Location*, *Train Station* and *Train Station Exit Point*, just to name a few of them, from [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html).

-   *Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary*, *HDB Property Information*, *School Directory and Information* and other relevant data from [Data.gov.sg](https://beta.data.gov.sg/).

### **Specially collected data**

-   Businesses, retail and services, leisure and recreation, etc geospatial data sets assemble by course instructor. (Refer to eLearn)
:::

# Task

The specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:

## **Geospatial Data Science**

-   Derive an analytical hexagon data of 375m (this distance is the perpendicular distance between the centre of the hexagon and its edges) to represent the [traffic analysis zone (TAZ)](https://tmg.utoronto.ca/files/Reports/Traffic-Zone-Guidance_March-2021_Final.pdf).

-   With reference to the time intervals provided in the table below, construct an O-D matrix of commuter flows for a time interval of your choice by integrating *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops* and *Bus Stop Location* from [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html). The O-D matrix must be aggregated at the analytics hexagon level

    | Peak hour period             | Bus tap on time  | What it Means (Likely)                                            |
    |-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
    | ***Weekday morning peak***   | ***6am to 9am*** | ***Going to work and school (our data will be focused on this)*** |
    | Weekday afternoon peak       | 5pm to 8pm       | Returning home from work or school                                |
    | Weekend/holiday morning peak | 11am to 2pm      | Heading out for retail shopping, attractions etc                  |
    | Weekend/holiday evening peak | 4pm to 7pm       | Returning home for Mon Blues                                      |

-   Display the O-D flows of the passenger trips by using appropriate geovisualisation methods (not more than 5 maps).

-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the geovisualisation (not more than 100 words per visual).

-   Assemble at least three propulsive and three attractiveness variables by using aspatial and geospatial from publicly available sources.

-   Compute a distance matrix by using the analytical hexagon data derived earlier.

## **Spatial Interaction Modelling**

-   Calibrate spatial interactive models to determine factors affecting urban commuting flows at the selected time interval.

-   Present the modelling results by using appropriate geovisualisation and graphical visualisation methods. (Not more than 5 visuals)

-   With reference to the Spatial Interaction Model output tables, maps and data visualisation prepared, describe the modelling results. (not more than 100 words per visual).

# Getting Started

               performance, reshape2,
               ggpubr, tidyverse, stplanr, jsonlite)

```

## Preparing the Flow Data

::: panel-tabset
## Importing the OD Data

```{r}
#|eval: false

odbus <- read_csv("data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202310.csv")
```

## Extracting the Data according to the Weekday AM period

```{r}
#|eval: false
odbus6_9 <- odbus %>%
  filter(DAY_TYPE == "WEEKDAY") %>%
  filter(TIME_PER_HOUR >= 6 &

```

## Creating Hexagonal Grids

Create analytical hexagon data of 325m (this distance is the perpendicular distance between the centre of the hexagon and its edges) - so should be **c(750, 750)**.

```{r}
#|eval: false
hexagon_grid = st_make_grid(busstops, c(750, 750), what = "polygons", square = FALSE)

hexagon_grid_sf = st_sf(hexagon_grid) %>%
  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(hexagon_grid)))
```

## Combine with Hexagon Grid

```{r}
#|eval: false
hexagon_grid_sf$n_busstops = lengths(st_intersects(hexagon_grid_sf, busstops))

hexagon_busstop = filter(hexagon_grid_sf, n_busstops > 0)

busstop_grid <- st_intersection(busstops, hexagon_grid_sf)%>%
  select(BUS_STOP_N, grid_id) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()



```

od_data_wdam <- left_join(od_data_wdam , busstop_grid,
            by = c("DESTIN_BS" = "BUS_STOP_N")) 

duplicate <- od_data_wdam %>%
  group_by_all() %>%
  filter(n()>1) %>%
  ungroup()

od_data_wdam <- unique(od_data_wdam)

od_data_wdam <- od_data_wdam %>%
  rename(DESTIN_Grid = grid_id) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_Grid, DESTIN_Grid) %>%
  summarise(MORNING_PEAK = sum(TRIPS))

#Removing Intra-Grid Flow
od_wdam_cleaned <- od_data_wdam[od_data_wdam$ORIGIN_Grid!=od_data_wdam$DESTIN_Grid,]
```
:::

## Write/Read Data into rds for Subsequent Usage

# Analysis

## Spatial Patterns

## Attractiveness Variables

We will compile three attractiveness variables, namely:

-   Schools (their place of study)

-   Business (their place of work)

-   F&B (to buy breakfast before heading to their final destination, assuming that they will buy food nearer to their location)

### Preparing the School Data (using data from In Class Ex 4)

```{r}
#| eval: false

hexagon_bustops$SCHOOL_COUNT <- lengths(
  st_intersects(
    hexagon_bustops, schools_sf))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

sum(hexagon_bustops$SCHOOL_COUNT)
```

### Preparing the Business Data

We assume that the businesses equate to the companies etc that people will travel to for their work.

```{r}
#| eval: false

business_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
               layer = "Business")

write_rds (business_sf, "data/rds/business_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

hexagon_bustops$BIZ_COUNT <- lengths(
  st_intersects(
    hexagon_bustops, business_sf))
```

### Preparing the F&B Data

```{r}
#| eval: false

food_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
               layer = "F&B") %>%
  st_transform (crs=3414)

write_rds (food_sf, "data/rds/food_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

hexagon_bustops$FOOD_COUNT <- lengths(
  st_intersects(hexagon_bustops, food_sf))
```

## Propulsive Variables

We will look at three propulsive variables, namely:

-   Number of Population

-   Number of Train Stations Exits

-   Number of Bus Stops (already available since Take Home Ex 1)

-   Location of Pre Schools (assuming parents will bring their child to the nearest pre-school which should be within walking distance, before going to the nearest bus stop to travel for work)

-   Number of Buses available within each grid - tried to obtain the bus route data from LTA Data Mall, but there data seems limited and outdated (no actual date on when it was last updated); so decided not to pursue this.

### Preparing the Data on Populace

We utilise the hdb data provided by Prof.

```{r}
#| eval: false
hdb <- read_csv ("data/aspatial/hdb.csv")
```

Based on the data, we will be able to intersect the locations, types of dwellings (whether 1-room, 2-room, rental and etc) to have an estimate on the number of population in each grid.

So based on past studies in 2018:

| Types of Dwelling | Average Household Size | Remarks |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| 1-Room / Rental   | 2.3                    |         |
| 2-Room            | 2.19                   |         |
| 3-Room            | 2.63                   |         |
| 4-Room            | 3.42                   |         |
| 5-Room / Exec     | 3.77                   |         |

```{r}
#| eval: false
hdb_tidy <- hdb %>%
  select(13:25, "lat", "lng") %>%
  mutate(one_Rm = (`1room_sold` + `1room_rental` + studio_apartment_sold + other_room_rental)*2.3) %>%
  mutate(two_Rm = (`2room_sold` + `2room_rental`)*2.19) %>%
  mutate(three_Rm = (`3room_sold` + `3room_rental`)*2.63) %>%
  mutate(four_Rm = (`4room_sold`) * 3.42) %>%
  mutate(five_rm = (`5room_sold` + `exec_sold` + multigen_sold)*3.77)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
hdb_tidy <- hdb_tidy %>%
  select (14:20) %>%
  mutate (pop = one_Rm + two_Rm + three_Rm + four_Rm + five_rm)
```

Covert to sf data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
hdb_sf <- st_as_sf(hdb_tidy,
                      coords = c("lng", "lat"),
                      crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform (crs=3414)

write_rds (hdb_sf, "data/rds/hdb_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
hexagon_bustops$POP <- sapply(
  st_intersects(hexagon_bustops, hdb_sf),
  function(indices) sum(hdb_sf$pop[indices])
)
```

### Train Station Exit

I think that the train station exits can be considered as both propulsive and attractive, e.g. people will take buses to the nearest train station exit, then take on the mrt to their next destination.

But they can also exit from the train station, then proceed to take bus to their place of work or study.

I downloaded the static shp file of the train station exits from LTADataMall.

```{r}
#| eval: false
train_exits_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
               layer = "Train_Station_Exit_Layer") %>%
  st_transform (crs=3414)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds (train_exits_sf, "data/rds/train_exits_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
hexagon_bustops$TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT <- lengths(
  st_intersects(
    hexagon_bustops, train_exits_sf))
```

### Location of Pre-Schools

Using the Onemap API, I gain access to the "Child Care Services" theme.

This is updated by ECDA in Dec 23 and i saved it in JSON format.

I will use the `jsonlite` package to convert the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
childcare <- fromJSON("data/aspatial/childcare.json", flatten = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
childcare_tidy <- childcare %>%
  select(9:14) %>%
  slice(-1) %>%
  separate(col = SrchResults.LatLng, into = c("lat", "long"), sep = ",", convert = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

childcare_sf <- st_as_sf(childcare_tidy,
                      coords = c("long", "lat"),
                      crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform (crs=3414)

write_rds (childcare_sf, "data/rds/childcare_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

hexagon_bustops$CHILDCARE_COUNT <- lengths(
  st_intersects(
    hexagon_bustops, childcare_sf))
```

All the data were combined and written into an rds file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds (hexagon_bustops, "data/rds/combined_data.rds")
```

```{r}
combined_data <- read_rds("data/rds/combined_data.rds")
```

# Spatial Interaction Modelling

## Computing the Distance Matrix

```{r}
#| eval: false  

hexa_sp <- as(hexagon_busstop,"Spatial")  
hexa_sp
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 

dist <- spDists(hexa_sp,                  
                longlat = FALSE) #latlong is FALSE cuz its is in Svy21 alr  
head(dist, n=c(10, 10))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
hexa_id <- hexagon_busstop$grid_id
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
colnames(dist) <- paste0(hexa_id) rownames(dist) <- paste0(hexa_id)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
distPair <- melt(dist) %>%   rename(dist = value) head(distPair, 10)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 

distPair$dist <- ifelse(distPair$dist == 0,                         
                        50, distPair$dist)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
distPair <- distPair %>%   rename(orig = Var1,          
                                  dest = Var2)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
write_rds(distPair, "data/rds/distPair.rds") 
```

```{r}
distPair <- read_rds("data/rds/distPair.rds")
```

## Preparing the Flow Data

### Grouping the Flow Data

```{r}
flow_data <- od_wdam_cleaned %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_Grid, DESTIN_Grid) %>% 
  summarize(TRIPS = sum(MORNING_PEAK)) 
```

```{r}
flow_data <- od2line(flow = flow_data, 
                    zones = hexagon_grid_sf,
                    zone_code = "grid_id")
```

### Separating the Intra-Flow Data

```{r}
flow_data$FlowNoIntra <- ifelse(
  flow_data$ORIGIN_Grid == flow_data$DESTIN_Grid, 
  0, flow_data$TRIPS)
flow_data$offset <- ifelse(
  flow_data$ORIGIN_Grid == flow_data$DESTIN_Grid, 
  0.000001, 1)
```

### Combining Passenger Volume Data with Dist Data

```{r}
flow_data1 <- flow_data %>%
  left_join (distPair,
             by = c("ORIGIN_Grid" = "orig",
                    "DESTIN_Grid" = "dest"))
```

### Combining the Data with Propulsive and Attractive Variables Data

```{r}
#| eval: false
combined_tidy <- combined_data %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
combined_tidy$DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS <- combined_tidy$TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
flow_data_tidy <- flow_data1 %>%
  left_join(
    combined_tidy %>% 
      select(grid_id, SCHOOL_COUNT, BIZ_COUNT, FOOD_COUNT, DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS),
      by = c("DESTIN_Grid" = "grid_id")
  ) %>%
  rename(DIST = dist)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

flow_data_tidy <- flow_data_tidy %>%
  left_join(
    combined_tidy %>% 
      select(grid_id, POP, TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT, CHILDCARE_COUNT, n_busstops),
      by = c("ORIGIN_Grid" = "grid_id")
  ) 
```

Ensure variables with value = 0 are adjusted to 0.99.

```{r}
#| eval: false

flow_data_tidy$SCHOOL_COUNT <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$SCHOOL_COUNT == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$SCHOOL_COUNT)

flow_data_tidy$BIZ_COUNT <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$BIZ_COUNT == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$BIZ_COUNT)

flow_data_tidy$FOOD_COUNT <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$FOOD_COUNT == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$FOOD_COUNT)

flow_data_tidy$TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT)

flow_data_tidy$DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS)

flow_data_tidy$POP <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$POP == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$POP)

flow_data_tidy$CHILDCARE_COUNT <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$CHILDCARE_COUNT == 0,
  0.99, flow_data_tidy$CHILDCARE_COUNT)

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds (flow_data_tidy, "data/rds/flow_data_tidy.rds")
```

# Calibrating Spatial Interaction Models

```{r}
flow_data_tidy <- read_rds ("data/rds/flow_data_tidy.rds")
```

We will calibrate separate Spatial Interaction Models for inter- and intra-zonal flows. For the Ex, we will focus our attention on inter-zonal flow. Hence, we need to exclude the intra-zonal flow from *flow_data*.

First, two new columns called *FlowNoIntra* and *offset* will be created by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
flow_data_tidy$FlowNoIntra <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$ORIGIN_Grid == flow_data_tidy$DESTIN_Grid, 
  0, flow_data_tidy$TRIPS)

flow_data_tidy$offset <- ifelse(
  flow_data_tidy$ORIGIN_Grid == flow_data_tidy$DESTIN_Grid, 
  0.000001, 1)
```

According to the syntax used to derive values in *FlowNoIntra* field, all intra-zonal flow will be given a value of 0 or else the original flow values will be inserted.

Next, inter-zonal flow will be selected from flow_data and save into a new output data.frame called *inter_zonal_flow* by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
inter_zonal_flow <- flow_data_tidy %>%
  filter(FlowNoIntra > 0) %>%
  mutate(ORIGIN_Grid = as.factor(ORIGIN_Grid)) %>%
  mutate(DESTIN_Grid = as.factor(DESTIN_Grid)) 
```

## Unconstrained Spatial Interaction Model 

```{r}
#| eval: false
uncSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                log(SCHOOL_COUNT) +
                log(BIZ_COUNT) +
                log(FOOD_COUNT) +
                log(POP) +
                log(TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT) +
                log(DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS) +
                log(CHILDCARE_COUNT) +
                log(n_busstops) +
                log(DIST),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = inter_zonal_flow,
              na.action = na.exclude)

write_rds(uncSIM, "data/rds/uncSIM.rds")

```

```{r}

uncSIM <- read_rds("data/rds/uncSIM.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(uncSIM)
```

## Origin - Constrained Model

::: callout-note
-   For origin-constrained model, only explanatory variables representing the attractiveness at the destinations will be used.

-   All the explanatory variables including distance will be log transformed.

-   *ORIGIN_Grid* is used to model 𝜇~𝑖~ . It must be in categorical data type.

-   It is important to note that -1 is added in the equation after the distance variable. The -1 serves the purpose of removing the intercept that by default, glm will insert into the model.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
orcSIM_Poisson <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                ORIGIN_Grid +
                log(SCHOOL_COUNT) +
                log(BIZ_COUNT) +
                log(FOOD_COUNT) +
                log(DESTIN_TRAIN_EXITS) +
                log(DIST) - 1,
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = inter_zonal_flow,
              na.action = na.exclude)

write_rds(orcSIM_Poisson, "data/rds/orcSIM_Poisson.rds")
```

```{r}

orcSIM_Poisson <- read_rds("data/rds/orcSIM_Poisson.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
tail(summary(orcSIM_Poisson)$coefficients, n = 10)
```

## Destination Constrained Model

Look at the propulsive variables.

```{r}
#| eval: false
decSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                DESTIN_Grid +
                log(POP) +
                log(CHILDCARE_COUNT) +
                log(TRAIN_EXITS_COUNT) +
                log(n_busstops) +
                log(DIST) - 1,
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = inter_zonal_flow,
              na.action = na.exclude)

write_rds(decSIM, "data/rds/decSIM.rds")
```

```{r}

decSIM <- read_rds("data/rds/decSIM.rds")
```

## Doubly Constrained Model 

```{r}
#| eval: false
dbcSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                ORIGIN_Grid + 
                DESTIN_Grid + 
                log(DIST),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = inter_zonal_flow,
              na.action = na.exclude)

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds (dbcSIM, "data/rds/dbcSIM.rds")
```

```{r}

dbcSIM <- read_rds("data/rds/dbcSIM.rds")
```

## Model Comparisons

We will use [`compare_performance()`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/compare_performance.html) of [**performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) package.

First of all, let us create a list called *model_list* by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
model_list <- list(unconstrained=uncSIM,
                   originConstrained=orcSIM_Poisson,
                   destinationConstrained=decSIM,
                   doublyConstrained=dbcSIM)
```

Next, we will compute the RMSE of all the models in *model_list* file by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
compare_performance(model_list,
                    metrics = "RMSE")
```

## Visualising the Fitted Values

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(uncSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

```{r}
SIM_data <- inter_zonal_flow %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(uncTRIPS = "uncSIM.fitted.values")
```

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(orcSIM_Poisson$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

```{r}
SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(orcTRIPS = "orcSIM_Poisson.fitted.values")
```

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(decSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

```{r}
SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(decTRIPS = "decSIM.fitted.values")
```

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(dbcSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

```{r}
SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(dbcTRIPS = "dbcSIM.fitted.values")
```

```{r}
write_rds(SIM_data, "data/rds/SIM_data.rds")
```

```{r}
unc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = uncTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

orc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = orcTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

dec_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = decTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

dbc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = dbcTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

ggarrange(unc_p, orc_p, dec_p, dbc_p,
          ncol = 2,
          nrow = 2)
```
